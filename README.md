# Currents-Conversion
Code needed to convert raw ADCP data collected in NCOP Current Surveys into a format that is compatible for ingestion into the database.

# Scripts:
1. ‘NortekFileConversion.m’ --> Use this to convert Nortek Aquadopp 3 beam upward looking or downward looking (various frequencies including 1 kHz - 2 kHz) ADCP raw data
3. [Nortek Place holder] --> Use this to convert Nortek Aquadopp 600 kHz 2 beam sidelooking raw ADCP data
4. [Nortek Place holder] --> Use this to convert Nortek AWAC & Continental 2D sidelooking raw ADCP data
5. [Fortran place holder] --> Use this to concatenate and convert Sontek (sidelooking?) data


# How to Run:
